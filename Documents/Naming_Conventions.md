# 🏷️ Naming Conventions

This guide defines the standard naming rules for **schemas**, **tables**, **views**, **columns**, and **stored procedures** used in the data warehouse.

## 🪶 General Standards

### 🔹 Naming Format  
Use `snake_case` — all lowercase with underscores separating words.  


### 🔹 Reserved Words  
Avoid SQL reserved words and system keywords.  

### 🔹 Consistency  
Keep names short, clear, and consistent across all layers to improve traceability and automation.


## 🧱 Table Naming Rules

### 🥉 **Bronze Layer**  
This layer mirrors **raw data** from source systems, with no transformations applied.

**Pattern:**  
```sql
<source_system>_<entity>
```

**Rules:**  
- Begin with the **source system name** (e.g., `crm`, `erp`).  
- Use the **original source table name** without renaming.  
- Preserve raw integrity — no transformation or business logic.  

**Example:**  
```sql
crm_customer_info
```
→ Customer information extracted from the CRM system.

💡 **Tip:** Bronze is your “single source of truth.” Keep it raw, consistent, and traceable.


### 🥈 **Silver Layer**  
The Silver layer standardizes, cleanses, and enriches Bronze data for analytics.

**Pattern:**  
```sql
<source_system>_<entity>
```

**Rules:**  
- Keep the `<source_system>` prefix for lineage clarity.  
- Merge or enrich only when necessary for analytics.  
- Maintain clear references to Bronze origins.  

**Example:**  
```sql
erp_sales_orders
```
→ Cleaned and standardized sales order data from the ERP source.

**Includes:**  
- **SCD2** (Slowly Changing Dimensions Type 2) → keeps historical versions for accurate trend analysis.  
- **DQ Checks** (Data Quality Validation) → detects nulls, duplicates, invalid values, and ensures consistency.


### 🥇 **Gold Layer**  
The Gold layer contains **business-ready data** — aggregated, integrated, and optimized for reporting.

**Pattern:**  
```sql
<category>_<entity>
```

**Rules:**  
- Use clear prefixes to describe the table type:
  - `dim_` → Dimension tables  
  - `fact_` → Fact tables  
  - `report_` → Summary or report-ready tables  
- The `<entity>` should represent a **business concept** (e.g., sales, customers).  

**Examples:**  
```sql
dim_product
fact_revenue
report_monthly_sales
```

**Notes:**  
- Gold tables are designed for **fast Power BI analytics**.  
- Support **RLS (Row-Level Security)** for controlled access.  
- Include **aggregated tables** to enhance query performance.


### 🗂 **Glossary of Common Prefixes**

| Prefix | Meaning | Example |
|--------|----------|----------|
| `dim_` | Dimension table | `dim_customer`, `dim_product` |
| `fact_` | Fact or transaction table | `fact_sales`, `fact_orders` |
| `report_` | Reporting or summary table | `report_kpi_summary` |


## 🧩 Column Naming Standards

### 🔑 Surrogate Keys
All surrogate keys or primary keys should end with `_key`.

**Pattern:**  
```sql
<table_name>_key
```

**Example:**  
```sql
customer_key
```
→ Surrogate key for the `dim_customer` table.


### ⚙️ Technical Columns
Metadata and system-generated columns must begin with the prefix `dwh_`.

**Pattern:**  
```sql
dwh_<column_name>
```

**Rules:**  
- `dwh_` prefix marks system-managed columns (not from source data).  
- Always describe their function clearly.  

**Examples:**  
```sql
dwh_load_date   -- Date record was loaded
dwh_update_user -- User or process that last modified the record
```


## ⚡️ Stored Procedures
Stored procedures manage the **ETL / ELT** flow between layers and must follow a uniform pattern.

**Pattern:**  
```sql
load_<layer>
```

**Examples:**  
```sql
load_bronze  -- Ingests raw data from CSV or APIs
load_silver  -- Cleanses and standardizes Bronze data
load_gold    -- Aggregates and publishes for reporting
```

**Tip:** Use consistent naming for easier automation in deployment pipelines and scheduled jobs.


### ✅ Summary

Following these conventions ensures:
- 🔄 Consistent naming across all layers  
- 🧩 Simplified automation for ETL pipelines  
- 📊 Seamless integration with BI tools like Power BI  
- 📁 Readable, professional data architecture documentation
