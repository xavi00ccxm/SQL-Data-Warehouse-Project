SQL Data Warehouse Project

Building a Modern Data Warehouse Using SQL Server, ETL, Data Modeling, and Analytics

📘 Project Overview

This repository demonstrates a complete data warehousing and analytics solution — from raw data ingestion to business-ready dashboards.
The project reflects my ongoing learning and practice in data engineering, data architecture, and analytics, using real-world concepts applied through SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), ETL processes, and Power BI visualizations.

The goal is to strengthen technical proficiency in designing, transforming, and modeling data while showcasing practical, end-to-end understanding of the Medallion Architecture:

Bronze Layer – Ingesting and storing raw source data.

Silver Layer – Cleaning, standardizing, and transforming data for analysis.

Gold Layer – Creating business-ready models (fact and dimension tables) for reporting and decision-making.

⚙️ Key Skills Applied

SQL Development & SSMS – Writing optimized queries, joins, and stored procedures.

ETL Pipelines – Extracting, transforming, and loading data for structured analysis.

Data Modeling – Implementing star schema structures for efficient analytics.

Data Architecture – Applying Medallion (Bronze–Silver–Gold) design principles.

Dynamic Reporting – Developing interactive dashboards in Power BI and Excel.

Data Analysis – Interpreting metrics, performance, and trends for stakeholders.

Front-End Support – Using HTML and CSS to document and present results professionally.
